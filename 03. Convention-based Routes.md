# Custom routing
The default routing application works for most scenarios but there are situations where we need `route` with multiple parameters, for e.x. */movies/released/2015/04* where we get movies by release *year* and *month*. So we need to create custom routes.<br>
So above default route we create a custome routes using `routes.MapRoute()`
>routes.MapRoute(<br>
>                "MoviesByReleasedDate",<br>
>                "movies/released/{year}/{month}",<br>
>                new { Controller = "Movies", action = "ByReleaseDate" },<br>
>                new {year=@"\d{4}", month = @"\d{2}"}<br>     
>                //Anonymous object creation//verbatim string d is for digits<br>
>                );<br> 

## Attribute routing
### In routing 
`routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes();`
### In controller
`[Route("movies/released/{year}/{month:regex(\\d{4}):range(1,12)"]`

In attribute routing the constraints which we can put are<br>
* min
* max
* minlength
* maxlength
* int
* float
* guid
