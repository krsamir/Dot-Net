# View Models
### Problem Statement
*As per the project*<br>
In the random view, We just display the name of the movies. But if need display the list of customers who have rented the movie.<br>
In our domain model, there may not be a relationship between movie and customer classes, so we need to pass two different models to this view.<br>
* Movies
* List of Customers<br><br>

But we have only one `Model property`.
So how do we solve the problem?<br>
### Solution
* So we use a `view model`. Every model is model specifically built for a view and it includes any data and rules specific to that view.
